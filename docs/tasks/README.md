# Task Documents

This directory contains task specifications that serve as prompts for AI coding agents.

## Purpose

These documents describe features, implementations, and changes that were requested during the development of pathman. They are written in a style suitable for providing context and direction to AI assistants like GitHub Copilot.

## Status at Release

At each release, all task documents are considered completed. However, the documents themselves are not guaranteed to be accurate reflections of the final implementation, as the actual code often evolves through conversational refinement during development.

## Usage

These documents serve as:
- Historical record of feature requests and development direction
- Reference material for understanding design decisions
- Potential starting points for future enhancements or related features

They should be viewed as development artifacts rather than authoritative technical documentation. For accurate information about pathman's behavior and features, refer to the README.md, user documentation, and the source code itself.
